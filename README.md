# Match Tracker
## Third Year Mobile Apps Project

This is my third year project for mobile apps development module. 

This is a universal app for the windows store. It can run on many platforms such as Windows 10 and Windows Phone.

I chose this project because i love sport and wanted to make a sports based APP and to display my knowledge of local storage, Localisation, GPS Usage, Data binding, use of layouts and my general coding skill in C#.

I have designed this app to be simplistic to use for the user and have an attractive layout.

This app lets the user modify team names and scores as they are watching a Match(Gaa or Soccer) and save the results to local storage on their device.

Users can them view results(listView) and delete them as they wish.

This app also has the ability to store stadium names and coordinates of where the user is sitting if they wish to do so.
The user can view and delete the data.
